# pIRCX release 2.4.1 - python release of cppIRCX
#
# A free open source IRCX server
#
# This is the config for your python IRCX server
# Here can you modify the server details and some of the characteristics of it's operation
# Make sure you finish the line with the ';' character.
#
# Note: This server is open source, due to the nature of open source, you can change it how you wish
#       You can change the code how you wish, thus making it pointless allowing you to change the server
#       raw messages using the conf file. If you ARE an advanced user and understand python, then feel free
#	to modify any code with the understanding that I will not be held responsible for any damages.
#

# Disable features

# D:IRCX:<oper exempt>;
#
# The above example would disable the use of the IRCX command, 
# hence making this a standard IRC server, use upper case only

# Note: This will not disable ACCESS and PROP, you can disable these though by using D:ACCESS;

D:USERS:0;
D:SUMMON:0;
D:EVENT:0;
D:WHOWAS:0;

# the commands below will take out most of the IRCX features

#D:IRCX:0;
#D:PROP:0;
#D:ACCESS:0;

# A security focus on many IRC servers is the ability to change nicknames rapidly
# the server by default will not allow any more than 5 changes in 30 seconds but you can modify this

# L:<method>:<server name>:<server address>:<port>:<password>:<server information>;
#
#
# for the server address when you're listening, use the address you want to bind to

# This is being currently programmed, you can play with it if you want but for now it only lets you connect to another server
# That is stable but I recommend not doing it because I haven't tested it fully.
